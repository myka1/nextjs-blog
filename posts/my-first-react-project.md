This is my first **react** project.

After I felt comfortable with html, css and javascript I decided to learn **react** by creating this project. I wanted to learn **react** basics by doing it and to add new features on the go. Also, I used **TypeScript** because I wanted to learn it also. Styling is not fully completed because I focused more on **react** basics and **TypeScript**. But I still work on this project, so later I will improve its styling and add new features.

If you have any suggestions or maybe you know how I could improve you can email me here [msmykolas@gmail.com](mailto:msmykolas@gmail.com)
